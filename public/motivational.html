  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

  <h1>Writing</h1> 
  <p>Writing has always and will always be the most superior medium of thought expression. If you can unambigously put it to writing, 
    then you have a clarity of mind that most humans will never attain. </p>

  <h1>The Simple masses</h1>
  <p>The real damage is done by those millions who want to 'survive.' The honest men who just want to be left in peace. <br/>
  Those who don't want their little lives disturbed by anything bigger than themselves.<br/>
  Those who won't take measure of their own strength, for fear of antagonizing their own weakness.<br/>
  Those who don't like to make waves-or enemies.<br/>
  Those for whom honour, truth, and principles are only literature.<br/>
  Those who live small, mate small, die small. It's the reductionist approach to life: if you keep small, you'll keep it under control.<br/>
  If you don't make any noise, the boogeyman won't find you. <br/>
  But it's all an illusion, because they die too, those people who roll up their spirits in tiny little balls so as to be safe.<br/>
  Safe?! From what? Life is always on the edge of death; narrow streets lead to the same place as wide avenues, and a little candle burns
  itself out just like a flaming torch does.<br/>
  I choose my own way to burn. <br/>
