    <h3><a href="https://www.starazi.com/movie/the-matrix">The Matrix </a></h3>
    <h4>I love this film's storyline because of the impeccable conspiracy theory that looked too real to be true</h4>

        <h3><a href="https://netnaija.xyz/the-outpost-2020/">The Outpost</a> </h3>


        <h4><p>This film was about the US marines stationed in the worst outpost in Afghanistan. The Taliban had 
        a lot of position advantage against the soldiers and thus used this to their advantage in striking
        the base so hard that it was eventually closed after losing so many good men</h4>

    <h3><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/300671-13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi">13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi</a> </h3>
    <h4><p>The setting was in Libya and the soldiers were former military now mercenaries 
    with the goal of protecting the US ambassador to Libya and the CIA staffs and agents on 
    ground. They were of course outnumbered and outgunned. They had the technical know-how to their 
    advantage and thus were able to hold their ground before help arrived. A lot of people 
    were lost, including the ambassador. </p>

    <h3><a href="https://netnaija.xyz/john-wick-chapter-4-2023/">John Wick Series</a></h3>


         <h4><p>The John Wick character was played by Keanu Reeves and it portrayed him as the 
        Baba Yaga (the ultimate villain) in their underworld of crime. He was an assassin who 
        finding love decided to do away with his old life and live normal. Trouble came knocking

    <h3> <a href="002 4.1-Webpages/4.3 HTML Porfolio Project/public/about.html">The Godfather Trilogy</a> </h3>
    <h4><p>The Mafia was represented in this film. Although very old as it was produced in the late
        90s it depicted the Mafia so well and I loved the power play displayed.</p></h4>

<h3><a href="https://netnaija.xyz/the-balkan-line-2019-russian/">The Balkan Line</a></h3>

    <h4><p>I have seen this film more than twice and still can't get enough. The sheer resilience of the 
    Russian mercenariesin securing a strategic airport to avoid the intervention of US in the 
    conflicts that have rocked the Eastern Europe. It showed what few people can do when
    the odds are aligned in their favour. </p></h4>
