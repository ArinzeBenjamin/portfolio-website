<h1 style="color: black;">About Me</h1>
<p>Arinze Benjamin I. is a professional Full Stack Web developer trained under the indomitable tutorship and mentorship of the renowned Dr. Angela Yu of AppBrewery following the 2023 WebDev Bootcamp. He is interested in e-commerce websites, company websites, organisations and private websites to help people put their works and or businesses out there to the whole world on the internet.</p>

<p>I have mastered the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, Node.js, WordPress and Squarespace. With this I can and will give you the best look and the best feel for your website and make sure that the back end is promptly developed well to meet the functionality requirements for successful management of your business. I pride myself as a developer who writes from scratch. Not sure how that makes me better than the rest or worse, but it allows me to effortlessly manage the code in the same way a building engineer who started the building project from scratch can easily trace any error he/she encounters on the way of the project. So, it might be for my own good then if you look at it. But whatever makes my job easier and smoother is automatically good for you too, isnâ€™t it? </p>

<p>If you are already at this page, chances are that you already know that you need a website, and this is one giant step to the right direction. The next big step is looking for the best shot at getting your website to a capable hand(s) and that is exactly where I come in.</p>
